# Screenshots — Thief Peer (manual capture instructions)

No screenshot in this repository is fabricated or auto-generated. This
file gives exact commands and manual steps so you (Edward/Donia) can
capture real screenshots yourselves. Claude has already run both peers'
real live GUI end to end (real FastMCP HTTP, real commit-reveal, real
capture/survival outcomes) and confirmed it works — see
`integration_lab/evidence/batch4a/gui_demo/gui_demo_summary.json` (both
replay verifiers report `VERIFIED`) — but taking the actual screenshots
requires a human at the keyboard.

**Batch 4B update**: the replay viewer now performs FULL BILATERAL
verification (both sides' commitments independently recomputed by each
repo's own crypto module under the unified `commitment/1` schema — see
`integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/commitment_schema_audit.md`), so the
valid-series banner text changed from a single-sided verdict to
`VERIFIED — BOTH PEERS INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED`. Captures 6–9 below point
at the new real bilateral evidence
(`integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/bilateral_series/`), not the Batch 4A
evidence (which remains valid, preserved, legacy-schema evidence — still
viewable, just not what these specific captures reference).

## Prerequisites

Both commands below must run from the repo root, in two separate terminal
windows, started within a few seconds of each other (each peer's own
`response_timeout_sec=30` applies while waiting for the other to connect).

## 1. Thief live GUI

```bash
cd thief_peer
uv run python -m thief_peer peer --gui --config-dir config/thief \
  --opponent-url http://127.0.0.1:8901/mcp
```

## 2. Police live GUI (start within a few seconds, separate terminal)

```bash
cd police_peer
uv run python -m police_peer peer --gui --config-dir config/police \
  --opponent-url http://127.0.0.1:8902/mcp
```

Both windows auto-close ~8 seconds after the game finishes
(`gui/tk_app.py`'s `AUTO_CLOSE_GRACE_MS`) — take your screenshots during
that window, or click "Quit" only after you're done capturing (closing
early on one side ends the other side's sub-game as a technical loss).

## What to capture (9 total)

1. **Thief live GUI, early game** — the board showing your own position/
   path, the "LIVE VIEW — OPPONENT TRUE POSITION HIDDEN" banner, and the
   status panel (state machine state, strategy class, connection status).
2. **Belief heatmap** — the second canvas, showing the shaded probability
   grid over where Thief believes Police might be (gold-outlined cells =
   top-5 most likely).
3. **Public barrier display** — once Police places a barrier, it appears
   as a dark cell on Thief's own board canvas too (public evidence, never
   Police's true position) — capture that moment.
4. **Protocol status** — the status panel's `last_message_type`,
   `commit_sent`/`ack_received`/`reveal_sent`/`reveal_received` fields
   updating turn to turn (visible if you resize/inspect during play).
5. **Capture/result banner** — the red banner turning into
   "SUB-GAME OVER: CAPTURE" (or SURVIVAL/TECHNICAL LOSS) at game end. The
   live window auto-closes ~8s after the game finishes
   (`gui/tk_app.py`'s `AUTO_CLOSE_GRACE_MS`) — capture within that window.

Save files 1–5 here as `thief_live_<description>.png`. Do not edit, crop
out data, or stage a fake result — if a run ends in something other than
survival, that is the real, honest outcome; save it as such.

## Replay viewer captures (bilateral series, Batch 4B)

```bash
cd thief_peer
uv run python -m thief_peer replay --gui \
  --police-artifacts ../integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/bilateral_series/police_artifacts \
  --thief-artifacts ../integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/bilateral_series/thief_artifacts
```

This window stays open until you click a control or close it (no
auto-close) — take your time.

6. **Full bilateral verification banner** — the green
   `VERIFIED — BOTH PEERS INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED` banner (confirmed real
   headless output: `integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/bilateral_series/bilateral_checks.json`).
7. **Sub-game selector + a capture step** — the selector row across all 6
   real sub-games, with a capture step selected showing both true paths
   converging.
8. **Barrier visible on the board** — any step where Police placed a
   barrier during the real series (`barrier_count` per sub-game is in
   `integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/bilateral_series/summary.json`).

### 9. TAMPERED demonstration (real, not staged)

`integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/bilateral_series/tampered_copy/`
contains a COPY of the real bilateral series with one field
(`steps[0].move` in `police_artifacts`) edited in the copy only — the
original evidence under `bilateral_series/` was never touched (still
verifies `VERIFIED`, confirmed directly, both directions). Reproduce:

```bash
cd thief_peer
uv run python -m thief_peer replay --gui \
  --police-artifacts ../integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/bilateral_series/tampered_copy/police_artifacts \
  --thief-artifacts ../integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/bilateral_series/tampered_copy/thief_artifacts
```

Real headless output (confirmed identical via the actual Tkinter
`VerdictBanner` widget, see
`integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/graphical_replay_regression/README.md`):
```
REPLAY VERDICT: TAMPERED
FULL_BILATERAL_VERIFICATION=false
thief: independently_verified=True verdict=VERIFIED
police: independently_verified=True verdict=TAMPERED
  - sub-game 1: commitment hash mismatch (tamper) (step 0)
```
Capture the red `TAMPERED — TAMPERED` banner with this finding listed.
Never edit or replace the original, valid evidence to produce this —
always work on a fresh copy.

Save files 6–9 here as `thief_replay_<description>.png`.

## Reproducibility

Real two-independent-process evidence (no GUI needed to reproduce the
underlying game) is at `integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/bilateral_series/`
(current, bilateral-schema series: commands, PIDs, stdout/stderr, exit
codes, both sides' replay-verify output, bilateral cross-verification
checks) and `integration_lab/evidence/batch4a/gui_demo/` (preserved
legacy-schema evidence from Batch 4A).
