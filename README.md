# AI2 Final Project — Thief Peer (thief_peer)

**Status: session recovery step C.** Everything from session recovery step B
plus: the canonical `declaration/2` Step-0 schema (risk #14, resolved), a
real 3x FastMCP lifecycle regression, a real one-sub-game two-process HTTP
game (`survival`, both sides' independently-written artifacts byte-matching,
both replay verifiers `VERIFIED`), a real six-sub-game two-process series
(6/6 sub-games, both replay verifiers `VERIFIED`, mutual artifact comparison
96/96 checks passed), an independent tamper-detection check, all 18 bounded
failure drills passing, and full quality/security gates. Six real,
previously-undiscovered cross-repo protocol/wiring defects were found and
fixed this step (risks #15-#16) — see `CHANGELOG.md` and
`integration_lab/audit/risk_register.md`. The `EntropyEscapeThiefBrain`
original strategy, GUI, Gmail reporting, public network exposure, and league
play are **not** implemented/run yet. Readiness: see
`integration_lab/audit/PROGRESS.md` for the current level.

## Abstract

_TODO (Phase 16): one-paragraph summary of the approach and headline results, written
only after real experiments exist. Not written yet — no results exist to summarize._

## Team

- Edward Haddad — 214083115
- Donia Naser — 212810493
- Provisional group ID: `edward-donia` (**configurable, requires final verification**
  against the course's binding group-ID assignment rule)

## Sibling repository

This is the **Thief** peer. The **Police** peer lives in a
separate, independent repository: `https://github.com/haddad0410-star/AI2_Final_Police_Edward_Donia` (placeholder URL — not
yet created/pushed).

Per the project's isolation rules, this repository does **not** import from the sibling
repository or from `integration_lab/` at runtime. Any resemblance in wire format is by
shared protocol contract only (see `docs/PROTOCOL.md`).

## What's actually implemented (Batch 1)

- **Configuration**: strict loaders/validators for `game.json` (shared, byte-identical
  with `police_peer`, SHA-256-verified), `game.toml` (private, rejects any attempt to
  override a shared field), `rate_limits.json`.
- **Domain models**: `Role`, `Position`/`Direction`, move/barrier/stay actions, hints,
  capture claim/response, `LocalPeerState` — structurally guaranteed (tested by field
  introspection, not just convention) to hold only this peer's own truth.
- **Board physics**: legal movement (4-orthogonal + STAY, no diagonals), barrier
  placement legality (own-cell or orthogonally-adjacent only, visually verified
  against the book), capture/scoring rules.
- **Scent + belief models**: exact 5x5 emission matrix and decay formula; a normalized
  probabilistic belief update (not claimed Bayesian-optimal) — see
  `docs/BELIEF_MODEL.md`.
- **Protocol schemas**: strict validation for every message category in
  `integration_lab/audit/protocol_contract.md`.
- **Minimal real FastMCP HTTP vertical slice**: `health`/`negotiate`/`propose_config`
  tools, proven over an actual two-independent-process HTTP handshake — evidence in
  `integration_lab/evidence/negotiation_smoke/`.
- **Batch 2 (verified in session recovery steps A/B)**: commit-reveal
  sealing, Step-0 declaration, state machine, deadline tracker + watchdog,
  extended FastMCP turn protocol, baseline strategy brain, template hints,
  sub-game runtime (Phase 9).
- **New this session (session recovery step B, Tasks 4-7)**: six-sub-game
  series runtime (Phase 10, `services/series_runtime.py`), JSON artifact
  generation (Phase 11, `services/artifact_models.py`/`artifact_builders.py`/
  `artifacts.py`/`series_artifacts.py`) verified byte-identical in schema to
  the independently-built Police repo's artifacts, headless replay
  verifier (Phase 12, `services/replay_verifier.py`), and full CLI wiring
  (`sdk/game_runner.py`, `run-subgame`/`run-series`/`verify-replay`/
  `show-status`). All independently implemented — no import of the Police
  repository.
- 292 tests, 93.80% coverage, 0 Ruff violations, every file ≤150 meaningful
  lines (session recovery step C; see `integration_lab/evidence/
  session_recovery_step_c/quality/`).

## Session recovery step C (new)

Canonical `declaration/2` schema frozen and verified byte-identical to the
Police repo's (risk #14, resolved). Real cross-process HTTP validated for
the first time: a 3x FastMCP lifecycle regression, a real one-sub-game
series (`survival`, winner thief, 35 steps, both replay verifiers
`VERIFIED`), a real six-sub-game series (6/6 games, mutual comparison 96/96
checks passed), an independent tamper-detection check, and all 18 bounded
failure drills — all genuinely passing. Fixed 6 real defects found only by
actually running two independent processes against each other for the first
time (sequence numbering, reveal wire shape/delivery model, envelope field
mismatch, per-sub-game sequence scoping, inbox message accumulation) — see
`CHANGELOG.md` and `integration_lab/audit/risk_register.md` risks #15-#16.
Full evidence: `integration_lab/evidence/session_recovery_step_c/`.

## What's not implemented yet

`EntropyEscapeThiefBrain` (the original candidate strategy — only the
from-scratch baseline exists), a live GUI, a visual replay *viewer* (the
headless verifier exists), Gmail reporting, public network exposure, and
league play. A real two-process game/series and the mutual cross-repo audit
**are now implemented and verified** (session recovery step C) — see above.

## Problem formulation

Distributed Cops-and-Robbers is framed as a two-agent, partially-observable pursuit
game (Dec-POMDP-flavored): each peer observes only its own true state, the opponent's
public scent trail, and the opponent's (possibly deceptive) natural-language hints —
never the opponent's true position. See `docs/PLAN.md` for the formal diagrams and
`integration_lab/audit/protocol_contract.md` for the wire-level contract both peers
must satisfy to interoperate with any other group's implementation.

## Architecture (summary)

Two fully independent FastMCP peers (server + client in one process), no central
referee, no shared mutable state. Full detail in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Game rules (summary)

Binding numeric parameters come from Appendix F of the course's rule book, extracted
and visually verified in `integration_lab/audit/binding_parameters.json` and
`integration_lab/audit/visual_verification.md`. Headline values: 7x7 board (minimum),
4-orthogonal + STAY movement, up to 14 barriers, up to 35 moves, 35-step survival
threshold, 5x5 scent grid decaying at 0.10/turn from a center intensity of 0.9, and a
**6-sub-game** series per opponent (constant).

## Strategy (summary)

Two brains are planned for this role: `BaselineThiefBrain` (a simple, original,
from-scratch greedy baseline — not a copy of the reference implementation) and
`EntropyEscapeThiefBrain` (our candidate original strategy). Neither has been
implemented or benchmarked yet, and no superiority claim is made for either — see
`integration_lab/audit/strategy_proposals.md` for the full design and
`docs/STRATEGY.md` for the role-local summary.

## Commit-reveal / security (summary)

Every step is sealed with SHA-256 over canonical JSON before being revealed, and a
mutual end-of-game audit re-verifies every hash. See `docs/SECURITY.md`.

## GUI / replay (summary)

Planned: a live GUI showing only this peer's own true state (never the opponent's true
position), and a replay viewer that recomputes every hash and reports VERIFIED/TAMPERED.
Not implemented yet. See `docs/PRD_gui_replay.md`.

## Experiments

Not run yet. Tuning-seed vs. held-out-seed split is pre-registered in
`integration_lab/audit/strategy_proposals.md` Section 0, before any strategy code
exists, specifically to prevent post-hoc seed selection.

## Limitations

See `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` — kept current, updated every phase.

adaptations (a commit-reveal hash shape, a token-bucket formula, an OAuth bootstrap
pattern, a protocol naming convention) — never substantial verbatim code. Full

## Submission tag

Not yet tagged. Will be `v1.0-submission` once `SUBMISSION_READY` (see
`integration_lab/audit/PROGRESS.md` for current readiness level — `LOCAL_READY`
as of session recovery step C; `NETWORK_READY`/`LEAGUE_READY`/`SUBMISSION_READY`
