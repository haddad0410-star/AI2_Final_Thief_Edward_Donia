# AI2 Final Project — Thief Peer (thief_peer)

**Status: Implementation Batch 1.** Configuration, domain models, board physics,
scent/belief models, protocol schemas, and a minimal real FastMCP HTTP vertical slice
(health/negotiate/config-hash-compare) are implemented and tested — see "What's
actually implemented" below. The full turn-by-turn game loop, strategy, cryptographic
lifecycle, GUI, replay, and Gmail reporting are **not** implemented yet.

## Abstract

_TODO (Phase 16): one-paragraph summary of the approach and headline results, written
only after real experiments exist. Not written yet — no results exist to summarize._

## Team

- Edward Haddad — 214083115
- Donia Naser — 212810493
- Provisional group ID: `edward-donia` (**configurable, requires final verification**
  against the course's binding group-ID assignment rule)

## Sibling repository

This is the **Thief** peer. The **Police** peer lives in a
separate, independent repository: `https://github.com/haddad0410-star/AI2_Final_Police_Edward_Donia` (placeholder URL — not
yet created/pushed).

Per the project's isolation rules, this repository does **not** import from the sibling
repository or from `integration_lab/` at runtime. Any resemblance in wire format is by
shared protocol contract only (see `docs/PROTOCOL.md`).

## What's actually implemented (Batch 1)

- **Configuration**: strict loaders/validators for `game.json` (shared, byte-identical
  with `police_peer`, SHA-256-verified), `game.toml` (private, rejects any attempt to
  override a shared field), `rate_limits.json`.
- **Domain models**: `Role`, `Position`/`Direction`, move/barrier/stay actions, hints,
  capture claim/response, `LocalPeerState` — structurally guaranteed (tested by field
  introspection, not just convention) to hold only this peer's own truth.
- **Board physics**: legal movement (4-orthogonal + STAY, no diagonals), barrier
  placement legality (own-cell or orthogonally-adjacent only, visually verified
  against the book), capture/scoring rules.
- **Scent + belief models**: exact 5x5 emission matrix and decay formula; a normalized
  probabilistic belief update (not claimed Bayesian-optimal) — see
  `docs/BELIEF_MODEL.md`.
- **Protocol schemas**: strict validation for every message category in
  `integration_lab/audit/protocol_contract.md`.
- **Minimal real FastMCP HTTP vertical slice**: `health`/`negotiate`/`propose_config`
  tools, proven over an actual two-independent-process HTTP handshake — evidence in
  `integration_lab/evidence/negotiation_smoke/`.
- 100 tests, 94.43% coverage, 0 Ruff violations, every file ≤150 meaningful lines.

## What's not implemented yet

A game engine that actually plays a sub-game, strategy logic, the full commit-reveal/
audit lifecycle, a state machine, GUI, replay viewer, or Gmail reporter. Those are
later batches, after this batch is reviewed and approved.

## Problem formulation

Distributed Cops-and-Robbers is framed as a two-agent, partially-observable pursuit
game (Dec-POMDP-flavored): each peer observes only its own true state, the opponent's
public scent trail, and the opponent's (possibly deceptive) natural-language hints —
never the opponent's true position. See `docs/PLAN.md` for the formal diagrams and
`integration_lab/audit/protocol_contract.md` for the wire-level contract both peers
must satisfy to interoperate with any other group's implementation.

## Architecture (summary)

Two fully independent FastMCP peers (server + client in one process), no central
referee, no shared mutable state. Full detail in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Game rules (summary)

Binding numeric parameters come from Appendix F of the course's rule book, extracted
and visually verified in `integration_lab/audit/binding_parameters.json` and
`integration_lab/audit/visual_verification.md`. Headline values: 7x7 board (minimum),
4-orthogonal + STAY movement, up to 14 barriers, up to 35 moves, 35-step survival
threshold, 5x5 scent grid decaying at 0.10/turn from a center intensity of 0.9, and a
**6-sub-game** series per opponent (constant).

## Strategy (summary)

Two brains are planned for this role: `BaselineThiefBrain` (a simple, original,
from-scratch greedy baseline — not a copy of the reference implementation) and
`EntropyEscapeThiefBrain` (our candidate original strategy). Neither has been
implemented or benchmarked yet, and no superiority claim is made for either — see
`integration_lab/audit/strategy_proposals.md` for the full design and
`docs/STRATEGY.md` for the role-local summary.

## Commit-reveal / security (summary)

Every step is sealed with SHA-256 over canonical JSON before being revealed, and a
mutual end-of-game audit re-verifies every hash. See `docs/SECURITY.md`.

## GUI / replay (summary)

Planned: a live GUI showing only this peer's own true state (never the opponent's true
position), and a replay viewer that recomputes every hash and reports VERIFIED/TAMPERED.
Not implemented yet. See `docs/PRD_gui_replay.md`.

## Experiments

Not run yet. Tuning-seed vs. held-out-seed split is pre-registered in
`integration_lab/audit/strategy_proposals.md` Section 0, before any strategy code
exists, specifically to prevent post-hoc seed selection.

## Limitations

See `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` — kept current, updated every phase.

## Reproduction

```
uv sync
uv run python -m thief_peer negotiate-smoke   # IMPLEMENTED (Batch 1) -- requires
                                                # police_peer's own negotiate-smoke
                                                # running too; see
                                                # integration_lab/run_negotiation_smoke.py
uv run python -m thief_peer peer --role thief --no-gui   # NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
```

## Third-party attribution

See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Reused elements are limited to small, attributed
adaptations (a commit-reveal hash shape, a token-bucket formula, an OAuth bootstrap
pattern, a protocol naming convention) — never substantial verbatim code. Full
classification: `integration_lab/audit/reference_reuse_plan.md`.

## Submission tag

Not yet tagged. Will be `v1.0-submission` once `SUBMISSION_READY` (see
`integration_lab/audit/PROGRESS.md` for current readiness level, which remains below
`LOCAL_READY` as of this scaffold).
