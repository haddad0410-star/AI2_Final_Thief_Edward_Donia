# Limitations — Thief Peer

Current, honest state as of this scaffold (Phase 1-2, no application code written):

- No FastMCP server/client exists — nothing here has run over real HTTP yet.
- No game engine, state machine, strategy, scent/belief model, cryptography, GUI,
  replay, or Gmail sender is implemented.
- `pheromone_min_center_intensity=0.5` (seen in the reference repo's config) is not
  confirmed as a binding Appendix F value — tracked as an open item, not assumed.
  See `integration_lab/audit/risk_register.md` risk #2.
- Repository visibility (public vs. private) and its licensing implications are
  unresolved pending your decision — see `integration_lab/audit/manual_gates.md`
  Gate E.
- No league opponent, public network exposure, or Gmail send has occurred.

This file will be kept current every phase — never allowed to go stale while claiming
a higher readiness level than `integration_lab/audit/PROGRESS.md` supports.
