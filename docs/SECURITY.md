# Security — Thief Peer

## Threat model summary

Full detail: `integration_lab/audit/risk_register.md` and (once written)
`reports/threat_model.md`. Core adversarial assumption per the book (Ch.5.2): the
opponent may attempt to rewrite history, deny a committed move, or lie about a
capture/win claim. Defense: SHA-256 commit-reveal (book Ch.5.3) plus a mutual
end-of-game audit that recomputes every hash.

## Secrets handling

- `credentials.json` / `token.json` live outside this repository, path supplied via
  `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_DIR` (see `.env-example`).
- `.gitignore` blocks `.env`, `credentials.json`, `token.json`, `client_secret*.json`.
- A `security_scan.py` script (not yet implemented) will assert none of these are ever
  staged.

## Planned security test categories (`tests/security/`)

- Tamper injection: alter move, hint, verdict, nonce, step, config, capture answer,
  record order — each must be detected by the audit.
- Nonce reuse rejection.
- Constant-time comparison on reveal verification (no timing side-channel).
- False capture-claim / false win-claim detection.
- Secret-file absence enforcement.

None of these tests exist yet — this document is the plan, not the evidence.
