# Security — Thief Peer

## Threat model summary

Full detail: `integration_lab/audit/risk_register.md` and (once written)
`reports/threat_model.md`. Core adversarial assumption per the book (Ch.5.2): the
opponent may attempt to rewrite history, deny a committed move, or lie about a
capture/win claim. Defense: SHA-256 commit-reveal (book Ch.5.3) plus a mutual
end-of-game audit that recomputes every hash.

## Secrets handling

- `credentials.json` / `token.json` live outside this repository, path supplied via
  `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_DIR` (see `.env-example`).
- `.gitignore` blocks `.env`, `credentials.json`, `token.json`, `client_secret*.json`.
- `integration_lab/security_scan.py` (implemented, Batch 1) asserts none of these are
  present/tracked, scans for API-key-like patterns, hardcoded Windows paths, reference-
  repo group identities, hardcoded paid-model-provider defaults, and a wrong
  `num_games` in the real league config. Real output (clean):
  `integration_lab/evidence/security_scan_output.json`.
- `integration_lab/verify_isolation.py` (implemented, Batch 1) asserts no cross-repo
  imports, no cross-repo config paths, no opponent-true-position field names, and no
  shared-state module hints. Real output (clean):
  `integration_lab/evidence/verify_isolation_output.json`.

## Batch 1 protocol-schema validation (implemented)

Every message category (health, declaration, config proposal, negotiation ack, turn
commitment, turn reveal, public turn envelope, hint, scent payload, barrier
declaration, capture claim/response, audit submission, control, protocol error) has
strict `__post_init__` validation and negative tests — 23 tests in
`tests/protocol/test_protocol_schemas.py`. This validates message *shape*; it does not
yet implement the commit-reveal *lifecycle* (see below).

## Planned security test categories (`tests/security/`) — later batch

- Tamper injection: alter move, hint, verdict, nonce, step, config, capture answer,
  record order — each must be detected by the audit.
- Nonce reuse rejection.
- Constant-time comparison on reveal verification (no timing side-channel).
- False capture-claim / false win-claim detection.

None of these lifecycle tests exist yet — commit-reveal is schema-only this batch
(`src/thief_peer/protocol/messages_turn.py`, `messages_capture.py`); the full sealing/
audit implementation is a later batch. This document will be updated again then.
