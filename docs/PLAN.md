# PLAN — Thief Peer

Diagrams below are intentionally text-based (Mermaid) placeholders for this scaffold
phase — no GUI/rendering exists yet to produce real screenshots, and Mermaid renders in
most Markdown viewers (including GitHub) without extra tooling.

## C4 context diagram

```mermaid

    P[Thief Peer<br/>this repo] <-->|FastMCP HTTP<br/>signed wire protocol| O[Police Peer<br/>sibling repo]
    P -->|dry-run/draft/send| G[Gmail API]
    U[Edward / Donia] -->|local GUI| P
```

## Container diagram

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Thief Peer process"
        SRV[FastMCP Server<br/>exposes tools]
        CLI[FastMCP Client<br/>calls opponent]
        RT[PeerRuntime / state machine]
        DOM[Domain: board, rules, scent, belief, scoring]
        STRAT[Strategy: BaselineThiefBrain, EntropyEscapeThiefBrain]
        GUI[Live GUI + Replay Viewer]
        SDK[SDK facade]
    end
    SRV --> RT
    CLI --> RT

## Component diagram (this repo's `src/thief_peer/`)

```mermaid

## Deployment diagram

```mermaid

    subgraph "localhost (dev)"
        PP["Thief peer :8902"]
    end
    subgraph "localhost (dev, sibling process)"
        OP["Police peer :8901"]
    end
    PP <-->|http://127.0.0.1| OP

## State machine (per book Ch.8, names to be reconciled with the book's exact labels)

```mermaid

    INITIALIZING --> SERVER_READY
    SERVER_READY --> NEGOTIATING
    NEGOTIATING --> SIGNED
    SIGNED --> WAITING

    AUDITING --> ERROR
    WAITING --> ERROR
    THINKING --> ERROR
    ERROR --> QUIT
    SERIES_COMPLETE --> QUIT
    QUIT --> [*]
```

## Sequence diagram — one move

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Me as Thief (me)
    participant Opp as Police (opponent)
    Me->>Opp: receive_turn(commit: H_commit only)
    Opp-->>Me: ack
    Me->>Opp: receive_turn(reveal: move + hint, nonce hidden)
    Opp-->>Me: ack
```

## Sequence diagram — commit-reveal audit (end of series)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Me as Thief (me)
    participant Opp as Police (opponent)
    Me->>Opp: submit_audit(records + all nonces)
    Opp->>Opp: recompute every H_commit, compare
    Opp-->>Me: submit_audit(records + all nonces)
    Me->>Me: recompute every H_commit, compare
    Note over Me,Opp: Any mismatch = tamper_forfeit, both sides report VERIFIED/TAMPERED
```

## Threat model

See `docs/SECURITY.md` and `integration_lab/audit/risk_register.md`.

## Failure/recovery model

DeadlineTracker + Watchdog (book Ch.8.4); see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
Implemented and tested (Batch 2: `domain/deadline.py`, `domain/watchdog.py`).
Production server shutdown (a related but distinct concern -- releasing the
HTTP listening socket cleanly) was hardened in session recovery step B; see
`infrastructure/server_lifecycle.py` and the CHANGELOG.

## Data schemas

See `integration_lab/audit/protocol_contract.md` Section 5 and `PRD_commit_reveal.md`.
