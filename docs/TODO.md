Do not mark a task DONE before its evidence file exists — see `CLAUDE.md`'s
no-fabricated-evidence rule.

## Session recovery step C (this session)

Resolved the declaration schema divergence (risk #14, canonical
`declaration/2`); verified all four artifact contracts compatible; ran a
real FastMCP lifecycle regression (3x); ran a REAL one-sub-game two-process
HTTP game (Phase 4/14 in the table above, first real cross-process game);
ran a real six-sub-game two-process HTTP series (Phase 14); ran the mutual
cross-repo audit (96/96 checks passed); ran 18 bounded failure drills (Phase
9); ran full quality/security/reproducibility gates (Phase 13). Six real
cross-repo protocol defects found and fixed only by actually running two
independent processes — see `CHANGELOG.md` and
`integration_lab/audit/risk_register.md` risks #15-#16. Phases 4 (remainder),
9, 11, 13, 14 in the table above should now be read as DONE per this step's
evidence (`integration_lab/evidence/session_recovery_step_c/`); the table
itself predates Batch 2/step C numbering — treat `PROGRESS.md` as the
current source of truth. Readiness: `LOCAL_READY`.

## Session recovery step A (this session)

The Batch 2 background agent for this repo was killed mid-run by
infrastructure failures (not task-logic failures) with a large amount of
uncommitted Phase 3-9-range work in progress — but explicitly **without**
Phases 10-12 (series runtime, artifact generator, replay verifier) or the
`run-subgame`/`run-series`/`verify-replay` CLI wiring, none of which exist in
this repo yet (see `integration_lab/evidence/session_recovery/
recovery_notes.md`). This recovery step fixed only the one specific bug that
agent was mid-fix on (an illegal `WAITING -> BEGIN_AUDIT` state transition
when a caller-supplied turn cap is smaller than the configured
`survival_threshold` — see `integration_lab/evidence/
session_recovery_step_a/thief_state_fix/`) plus a Ruff unused-import fix and
quality gates; it did not implement Phases 10-12, run a real two-process
series, or advance readiness past `LOCAL_READY`. The phase table above still
reflects Batch 1 status only and has not been re-audited phase-by-phase
against the uncommitted Batch 2 work in this recovery step — that re-audit,
plus Phases 10-12, is Recovery Step B+ work, not this step.

## Session recovery step B (this session)

Implemented Phases 10-12 and CLI wiring from scratch (independent
implementation, no import of the Police repository): `services/
series_runtime.py` (Phase 10), `services/artifact_models.py`/
`artifact_builders.py`/`artifacts.py`/`series_artifacts.py` (Phase 11),
`services/replay_verifier.py`/`replay_loader.py`/`replay_checks.py` (Phase
12), and `sdk/game_runner.py` + `run-subgame`/`run-series`/`verify-replay`/
`show-status` in `__main__.py`. Also fixed the production FastMCP/Uvicorn
shutdown defect (see `CHANGELOG.md`) and hardened `mcp_client.py` against
`ToolError`. Thief grew from 220 tests (step A checkpoint) to 281 tests,
94.79% coverage. Full detail: `integration_lab/evidence/
session_recovery_step_b/`. Still NOT implemented or run: a real
two-process series with an actual Police opponent, the mutual cross-repo
audit, GUI, replay viewer (Phase 10 in the table above), Gmail (Phase 12 in
the table above), public network/league play (Phase 15), or advanced
strategy (`EntropyEscapeThiefBrain`, Phase 7). The phase table's numbering
above predates Batch 2 and does not line up 1:1 with the Batch-2 phase
numbers used in `integration_lab/audit/PROGRESS.md` and the CHANGELOG —
treat the table above as historical (Batch 1) and the CHANGELOG +
PROGRESS.md as the current source of truth for Batch 2 status.

## Implementation Batch 4A (this session)

GUI (Phase 10 in the table above), replay viewer, and Gmail reporting
(Phase 12) are now **DONE** (dry-run only for Gmail — real send gated
behind Manual Gate C, never invoked). Public network/league play (Phase
15) remains preparation-only (Manual Gates A/B). See `CHANGELOG.md` and
`integration_lab/audit/PROGRESS.md` for full detail — this file's table
is not being retrofitted with a new numbering scheme for Batch 4A.
