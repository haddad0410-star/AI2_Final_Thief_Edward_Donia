sharNamr's documented construction: SHA256(canonical_json(payload) + "|" +
nonce), nonce appended as raw UTF-8 bytes after the canonical JSON, rather
than embedded as a payload field (contrast our own formula, matching the
book-cited H = SHA256(canonical_json(state, move, intent, nonce)),
Ch.5.3/App.E rule 17, where nonce IS a field inside the canonicalized
object).
