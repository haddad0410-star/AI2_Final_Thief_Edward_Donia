"""Movement, barrier, and capture rules -- visually verified against the book
(Ch.3.4 "Barrier Law" box, printed p.21; Appendix E rules 46-48), not HW6.

Interpretation note (see docs/adr/ADR-0011-trapped-thief-interpretation.md):
STAY is always legal (Appendix F Table 15: constant move set including STAY),
so a thief can never have zero legal actions. We therefore do NOT implement a
separate "trapped = automatic technical loss" rule beyond the two book-
confirmed early-end conditions: ordinary same-cell capture, and a barrier
placed on the thief's current cell (Appendix E rule 46).
