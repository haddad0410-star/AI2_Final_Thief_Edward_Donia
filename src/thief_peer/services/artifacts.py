"""Filename derivation, canonical save/load, and cross-artifact checks.

Filenames are ALWAYS derived from ``game_id`` programmatically -- never
hand-typed -- so files from different games cannot be mixed. Every save
validates the model and scans for accidental credentials; every load
validates the parsed schema. Independent implementation (no import of the
Police repository).
