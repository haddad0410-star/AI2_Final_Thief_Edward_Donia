"""Batch 4A Task 3: optional, registration-gated GUI event sink.

Follows the exact same "off by default, never affects gameplay" shape as
Batch 3.5's ``turn_trace.py`` diagnostic hook: headless runs never register
a sink, so ``publish`` is then a cheap no-op. When a GUI process registers
one (a thread-safe ``queue.Queue.put``), every publish is wrapped so a
rendering-side bug can never propagate into the real game loop -- the
turn loop's own correctness must never depend on the GUI being present,
correct, or even running.
