"""Deterministic game_id / game_uid derivation (protocol_contract.md §3.1).

Both peers derive these independently from data they already hold -- the
sorted group ids plus the negotiated terms -- so no extra round-trip is
needed and all four JSON artifacts share one identity. This is a pure
function of shared inputs (not a protocol message), documented as
clean-room-reimplementable in the contract -- both peers MUST compute the
same value from the same inputs for the ids to agree at all; this is an
independent implementation, not an import of the Police repository.

NOT a hash of the raw config file (an earlier version of this module was):
two peers' files can differ in whitespace, comments, or fields neither side
negotiates while still agreeing on every actual term, and a whole-file hash
silently diverges the uid in that case even though both sides' reports
otherwise agree on every value -- a documented cross-team failure mode this
construction exists to avoid (github.com/Imreec/copthief-league-protocol).
Must also match police_peer's own game_ids.py construction exactly, since
our two peers negotiate as one pairing.

``min_center_intensity`` (moamteam's 14th signed term) is included only when
the loaded config actually carries ``pheromone_min_center_intensity`` -- it
remains a non-binding optional extension for any OTHER pairing that hasn't
negotiated it (docs/risk_register.md risk #2).
