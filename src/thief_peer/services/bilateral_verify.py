"""Batch 4B Task 3/4/9: bilateral commitment verification -- the shared
service both the graphical/headless replay viewer (``gui.replay_view_model``)
and the Gmail report gate (``sdk.report_runner``) depend on, so neither the
GUI layer nor the report layer duplicates this logic (architecture rule:
CLI/GUI call into services, not the other way around).

Reuses the REAL, existing, unmodified replay-verification engine
(``services.replay_verifier.verify_replay``) for BOTH sides when both
sides' records use the current ``commitment/1`` canonical schema (Batch 4B
Task 3 unified the sealed field set so this repo's own crypto module can
correctly recompute the opponent's commitments too -- see
``integration_lab/evidence/batch4b/commitment_schema_audit.md``). Never
imports ``police_peer``; only calls this repo's own verifier on whichever
directory it's given.

Legacy note (Rule 10): a genuinely cross-repo LEGACY (pre-Batch-4B) record
still cannot be cryptographically re-verified by the other side -- this is
an explicit, honestly-labeled limitation, never silently hidden, and never
applied to current ``commitment/1`` records.
