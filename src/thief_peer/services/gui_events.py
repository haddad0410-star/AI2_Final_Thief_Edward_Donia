"""Batch 4A Task 3/4: GUI event contract, owned by the services layer (the
turn loop PUBLISHES these; ``gui/`` only ever CONSUMES them).

Every field here is deliberately restricted to what the live GUI is allowed
to show (own truth + public evidence + local belief). No event type in this
module carries the opponent's true position, unrevealed nonce, or the
sealed truth/lie verdict before its legal audit phase -- enforced by
``tests/unit/test_gui_no_opponent_leak.py``'s field-name scanner.
