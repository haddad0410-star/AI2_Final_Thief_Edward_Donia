"""Best-effort pre-game handshake push (SPEC section 4).

Split out of ``game_runner.py`` (150-line limit): some opponents refuse to
accept real turns into a live series until a signed agreement has landed in
their negotiate inbox first -- our own ``negotiate`` tool never required
this, so nothing in the real match flow ever sent one until this module.
