"""Validation rules for the shared game.json constitution.

Each `status` from Appendix F's own status-definitions (printed p.139, visually
verified) maps to a concrete rule here:

- constant  -> value must equal the Appendix F example exactly.
- minimum   -> value must be >= the Appendix F example.
- negotiable -> any value is structurally valid (semantic agreement is a
  runtime/negotiation concern, not a loader concern).

`num_games` is deliberately NOT enforced as a hard constant here even though
Appendix F Table 18 lists it as constant=6: a local single-sub-game smoke-test
fixture (game_smoke_1.json, a development-workspace fixture under the full
project workspace's integration_lab/config_fixtures/, not included in this
standalone package) legitimately uses
num_games=1 and must still load successfully. League-readiness (num_games==6)
is checked separately by `is_league_series_ready`, not by this loader.
