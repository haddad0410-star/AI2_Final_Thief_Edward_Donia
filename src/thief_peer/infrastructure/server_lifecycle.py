"""Real, graceful FastMCP HTTP server lifecycle.

Cancelling the ``asyncio.Task`` wrapping ``FastMCP.run_http_async()`` (this
module's previous implementation) does not reliably close the underlying
Uvicorn listening socket: ``uvicorn.Server._serve()`` only reaches its
socket-closing ``shutdown()`` when its own polling ``main_loop()`` returns
normally after observing ``should_exit`` -- there is no ``try/finally``
around that call, so a raw ``Task.cancel()`` skips ``shutdown()`` entirely
and permanently leaks the listening socket for the rest of the process.
Verified by direct experiment during the Batch-2 recovery (see the sibling
Police repo's ``integration_lab/evidence/session_recovery_step_a/
police_port_fix/`` and this workspace's ``session_recovery_step_b/
server_lifecycle/`` -- findings shared via the recovery evidence trail only,
never via a source import; this module is an independent implementation).

:class:`ManagedServer` owns a directly-built ``uvicorn.Server`` for FastMCP's
own real ASGI app (``mcp.http_app()`` -- the same app ``run_http_async``
itself would serve), so production code has an actual handle to request a
graceful stop (``should_exit``), escalate to a forced stop (``force_exit``,
skips waiting on in-flight connections) if that does not finish within a
bounded timeout, and cancel only as the absolute last resort -- honestly
classifying which of the three actually happened. Cancellation is never used
as the *normal* shutdown path, and nothing here globally suppresses
``CancelledError``: an unexpected cancellation of the server task from
outside this module still propagates.
