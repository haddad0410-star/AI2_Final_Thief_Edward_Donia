"""Gate A1: raw ASGI middleware applying :class:`IncomingGatekeeper` to the
public HTTP/MCP surface, before FastMCP's own routing/tool dispatch --
never inside an individual ``@mcp.tool`` function. A rejected request gets
an honest 429/503-style JSON response and the wrapped app is never called,
so a rejection can never reach a tool.
