"""Gate A1 correction: proactive OUTBOUND pacing toward a ``--public``
opponent.

Appendix F Table 19's own worked context (this project's ``rate_limits.json``
``_note``: "applies to this peer's own outbound API calls") makes the
Gatekeeper fundamentally a self-throttling mechanism: a well-behaved client
paces its own calls so it never needs the receiver to reject anything. This
complements (does not replace) the server-side incoming Gatekeeper, which
remains a defensive backstop against a misbehaving/malicious caller.

Unlike :class:`~thief_peer.services.incoming_gatekeeper.IncomingGatekeeper`
(which REJECTS once the budget is exhausted), :class:`OutboundPacer` WAITS --
a client is fully in control of its own cadence, so the correct behavior is
to hold back the next call rather than fire a burst and rely on 429/overload
responses. The wait is always bounded (at most one 60s window), so a whole
series is bounded too, never an infinite stall.
