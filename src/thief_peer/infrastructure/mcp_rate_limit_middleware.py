"""Gate A1 correction: FastMCP protocol-level rate-limit middleware, replacing
the earlier ASGI-level ``RateLimitMiddleware``.

The earlier ASGI middleware counted every raw HTTP request the streamable-HTTP
transport happens to use (session initialize, ``notifications/initialized``,
capability discovery, the real ``tools/call``, session teardown -- roughly 6
raw requests per one logical tool call). Appendix F Table 19's "30 requests
per minute" binding minimum is a logical-operation budget (the book's own
worked context is an outbound API-call Gatekeeper, e.g. one Gmail send = one
request), not a raw-transport-frame budget. Hooking ``on_call_tool`` instead
of the ASGI layer means exactly one accounting event per real tool invocation
(``negotiate``/``propose_config``/``receive_turn``/``submit_audit``/
``receive_control``), regardless of how many raw HTTP requests FastMCP's own
session plumbing needed underneath -- session/capability/teardown frames are
never charged against the budget, matching Appendix F's own scope (it says
nothing about transport internals).

``health`` is deliberately excluded from accounting: it is a liveness/
readiness probe (used by ``wait_for_health`` during startup, potentially many
times), not one of the game-protocol operations Appendix F's Gatekeeper table
is about.

Auth stays entirely at the ASGI level (``auth_middleware.py``) -- unchanged,
since it must guard session establishment itself, not just tool calls.
