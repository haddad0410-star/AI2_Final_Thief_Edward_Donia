"""Batch 4B Task 3/4/9: graphical replay viewer's data layer -- now capable
of FULL BILATERAL verification. The actual verification logic lives in
``services.bilateral_verify`` (shared with the Gmail report gate, Task 9,
so neither layer duplicates it); this module only shapes that result plus
the per-step display data (``ReplaySubGame``) for the viewer.

Legacy note (Rule 10): artifacts sealed under the OLD, pre-Batch-4B
per-repo schemas (Thief's ``sealed-turn/2``, Police's ``commit-reveal/2``)
remain readable for path/hint DISPLAY, but a genuinely cross-repo LEGACY
record can still not be cryptographically re-verified by the other side
-- this is an explicit, honestly-labeled legacy limitation, never
silently hidden, and never applied to current ``commitment/1`` records.

No Tkinter import here, so this is headlessly testable (Task 8).
