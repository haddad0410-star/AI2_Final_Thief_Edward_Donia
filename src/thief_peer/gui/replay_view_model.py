"""Batch 4A Task 7/8: graphical replay viewer's data layer. Reuses the
REAL, existing, independent replay-verification engine
(``services.replay_verifier.verify_replay``/``services.replay_loader.load_bundle``)
unmodified -- this module never recomputes a hash or re-implements any
cryptographic check itself; it only reshapes the SAME verified bundles for
display. No Tkinter import here, so this is headlessly testable (Task 8).

Unlike the live view model, both true trajectories are permitted here --
this module only ever reads FINALIZED, audited artifact files from disk
(each side's OWN independently-written 14-file set), never live private
runtime memory. Showing BOTH sides' true paths together requires BOTH
sides' artifact directories, since each side's own sealed log only ever
records its own true position -- reading the opponent's already-published
JSON artifact format is not a code dependency on the opponent's package,
just a public data-format parse (same as any third-party audit tool would
do).
